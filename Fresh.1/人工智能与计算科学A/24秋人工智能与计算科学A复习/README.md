# Project Name
The project is the note based on the course of *Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science* in *Beijing Institute of Technology*, 2024 Fall. 

# Author
*Len Fu*.

# Description
The notes are based on the examination syllabus of the course, 2024 Fall. Some detaild knowledge of the course is omitted to fit the syllabus(actually because I'm lazy to put something out of the syllabus into the note). In a word , the notes are suitable for review rather than learning.

Some math formulas in latex cannot be compiled correctly, they are surrunded by '$ $'.

# Usage
The notes are transformed from *Markdown* to *PDF* for easier propagation, put in the folder *note*. And all notes are protected by password from edition, but you can read the notes freely.

# Acknowledge

All teachers in the course of *Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science* in *Beijing Institute of Technology*, 2024 Fall. Especially, *Lecturer K.Y.Feng*.
